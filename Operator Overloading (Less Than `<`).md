# 🐍 Python OOP: Operator Overloading (Less Than `<`)

## 🎯 AIM

To write a Python program that demonstrates **operator overloading** by overloading the **less than (`<`)** operator using a custom class.



## 🧠 ALGORITHM

1. **Create Class `A`**:
   - Define the `__init__()` method to initialize the object with a value `a`.

2. **Overload the `<` Operator**:
   - Define the `__lt__()` method with logic:
     - If `self.a < o.a`, return `"ob1 is less than ob2"`
     - Else, return `"ob2 is less than ob1"`

3. **Create Objects**:
   - Instantiate two objects `ob1` and `ob2` with values.

4. **Use `<` Operator**:
   - Use `print(ob1 < ob2)` to trigger the overloaded behavior.



## 💻 Program
~~~


class A:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a


    def __lt__(self, o):
        if self.a < o.a:
            return "obj1 is less than obj2"
        else:
            return "obj2 is less than obj1"


obj1 = A(10)
obj2 = A(20)


print(obj1 < obj2)
~~~
## Output
obj1 is less than obj2


## Result
The program successfully demonstrates operator overloading in Python. By defining the __lt__() method, the < operator is customized to compare two objects of class A. Instead of returning True or False, it prints a descriptive message s
